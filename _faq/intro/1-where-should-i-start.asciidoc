= I just learned about CDI. Where should I start?
Antoine Sabot-Durand

The best way to start is our http://docs.jboss.org/cdi/learn/userguide/CDI-user-guide.html[user guide]. You'll also find a lot of resources on our link:/learn/[learning CDI page]. And when, ready, you really should check the CDI spec itself. See link:/download[CDI download page] for current CDI spec releases.
