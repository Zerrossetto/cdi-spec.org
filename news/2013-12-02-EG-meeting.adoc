The following people assisted this meeting :

* Jozef Hartinger (jh)
* Joseph Bergmark (jb)
* Phil Zampino (pz) (Java EE EG member)
* JJ Snyder (jj)
* Antoine Sabot-Durand (asd)

== Proposed Agenda 

The following agenda was proposed

1. Feed back on Java EE EG conf call we had on tuesday

2. Issues discussion : 9 issues where proposed

== Feedback on Java EE EG meeting

To sum up :

* Java EE EG is ok with our MR roadmap :
  - 16th Dec - list of issues complete
  - 6th Jan - Maintenance review starts
  - 7th March - Maintenance review ends
  - 21st March - Maintenance ballot ends
 
* According to JCP rules on update, we are going for CDI 1.2 (not 1.1.1)

* Regarding ticket https://issues.jboss.org/browse/CDI-370[CDI-370^] (Expand @RequestScoped and @SessionScoped to account for WebSocket) we agree that job should be done in Websocket Spec. So *asd* will work with *Stuart Douglas* to bring this point to the Websocket EG. The direct consequence for our MR is that CDI-370 is not in and should be closed after we check that Websocket EG got the point on their side.

* We also talk about classloader issue that were raised during https://issues.jboss.org/browse/CDI-377[CDI-377^] (automatic JSR-330 annotation processing problematic). EG members agreed that it's a good point but very difficult to resolve. It could only be solve in a major EE release.
