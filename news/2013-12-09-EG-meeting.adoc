== Back on CDI-377 (automatic JSR-330 annotation processing problematic)

This issue will be fixed in implementation and the sepc will mention something about recommendation to provide default exclusion list for most framework.
We still have to discuss if we introduce a jar exclusion mechanism in the spec or this will be based on existing package exclusion.

== Conclusion

We finished to deal with the list of Jira tickets we planned to introduce or not in MR. As we have a little more time it was decided to re-open the list for some more on next meeting
