== CDI TCK 1.1.3.Final released

We've just released CDI TCK 1.1.3.Final - the third bugfix version for CDI 1.1. The artifacts are available in the Maven central repository and the distribution zip file on [sourceforge.net](https://sourceforge.net/projects/jboss/files/CDI-TCK/1.1.3.Final/).

Note that the exclude list in the canonical [TestNG config file](https://github.com/cdi-spec/cdi-tck/blob/1.1/impl/src/main/resources/tck-tests.xml) is clean now.
