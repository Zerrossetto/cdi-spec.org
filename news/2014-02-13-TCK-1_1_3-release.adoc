We've just released CDI TCK 1.1.3.Final - the third bugfix version for CDI 1.1. The artifacts are available in the Maven central repository and the distribution zip file on https://sourceforge.net/projects/jboss/files/CDI-TCK/1.1.3.Final/[sourceforge.net^].

Note that the exclude list in the canonical https://github.com/cdi-spec/cdi-tck/blob/1.1/impl/src/main/resources/tck-tests.xml[TestNG config file] is clean now.
