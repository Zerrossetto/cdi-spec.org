== Release agenda

If everything stays on track we should send the PFD (proposed final draft) with TCK and RI to the JCP soon.

If the JCP ballot is green, CDI 2.0 final could be released before end of February.


== What's next

Our release plan for CDI 2.0 has always been to deliver it before Java EE 8 to let other spec grab our new features and make the best out of them.

We are still considering to start working on CDI 2.1 to clarify or add the few features needed for Java EE 8 and beyond.

Stay tuned.
